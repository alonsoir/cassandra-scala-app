This tiny project is my proof of concept about how to interact with a Cassandra server using scala code, nothing more.

There is a common subproject with all cassandra scala code, some tests and finally there is a main project which uses common subproject to run queries against cassandra.

In order to run it, download it and run the next commands:

HINT

An existing cassandra server must be running before you run this tiny proof of concept.
